## ‚úÖ Table Actions

### üü© Check In
Allows the admin to manually check in a member to a class.

- **Checkin Name**: Select from main member or any bundle sub-members.
- **Select Class**: Class dropdown filtered by current date and portal timezone.
- Triggers a success notification after check-in.

### üõ† Manage (Edit)
Slide-over form to update core user data:

- Name, Email, Profile Picture
- Membership Level
- Active status toggle
- Team Athlete toggle
- Embedded components<br/><sub>*some are only visible if 1 or more exist, i.e. if the user has no Agreements there will not be an Agreements dropdown*</sub>:
  - **Member Notes** 
    Allows you to record and view private notes about the member
  - **Audit Log** 
    Shows a record of changes made to the member
  - **Manage Subscriptions**
    Allows you to add, end, and pause active subscriptions on the member's account. You can also add recurring add-ons like locker rentals and charge prorated amounts immediately.

      #### üì¶ Current Subscriptions

      Each subscription entry shows:

      - **Membership**: The base plan name
      - **Start/End Dates**: When the subscription began and ends
      - **Status**: Stripe billing status (active, incomplete, etc.)
      - **Cancel**: Allows you to end the main subscription

      Beneath each subscription, you‚Äôll see a breakdown of attached items. This can include:

      - Membership-level plans
      - Add-ons like locker rentals, towel service, or coaching fees
      - The quantity for each item (e.g. 2x coaching blocks)<br/><br/>
      #### ‚ûï Add Recurring Items

      Admins can attach new recurring items (Stripe prices) to an existing subscription using the **‚ÄúAdd Item to Subscription‚Äù** form under each plan.

      - Select from available membership-level products
      - Set the quantity (usually `1`)
      - Click ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù to attach it to the subscription<br/><br/>

      #### ‚ö° Prorated Charges

      When you add a new item, the system will:

      1. Update the existing subscription
      2. Trigger a **prorated invoice** based on the time left in the current billing cycle
      3. **Immediately finalize and charge the invoice**<br/><br/>

      > If a $5/mo locker rental is added halfway through the month, the system will charge $2.50 immediately, and the full $5 will be added to the next monthly bill.

      This ensures members pay for what they use **now**, without waiting for the next renewal.

      #### üßπ Removing Subscription Items

      You can remove individual add-ons (like locker rentals) from the subscription. When removed, the member is no longer billed for that item starting immediately, and any applicable **refunds or credits** will be handled via Stripe's proration logic.

      > üí° Removing the **main subscription item** is not allowed via this menu. Use the ‚ÄúEnd‚Äù button in the main subscription row instead.

  - **Manage Accounts**  
  Manage additional members linked to this primary account. There are two types:

      #### üë§ Sub-Accounts (With Login Access)
      - Treated as full members.
      - Get their **own login**, profile, and access to the member portal.
      - Can register for classes **independently**.
      - Payment is handled by the **primary account holder**.
      - Best for adult dependents, spouses, or teens with their own device.<br/><br/>

      #### üë∂ Bundle Accounts (Without Login)
      - **No login or separate portal access**.
      - Designed for minors or family members using a shared email.
      - Can be checked in via the kiosk **under the main account‚Äôs name**.
      - Best for young children or households managing multiple people under one email.<br/><br/>

      > Sub-accounts appear in filters and reports like standard members.  
      > Bundle accounts remain grouped under the main profile but are tracked individually for attendance and notes.<br/>
      > **You will still need to add separate subscriptions for the bundled and sub accounts to actually start billing**
