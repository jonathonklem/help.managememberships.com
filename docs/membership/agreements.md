# Agreements

Agreement templates define the waivers or contracts your members must agree to before activating their membership. Each agreement **must be associated with at least one membership level** — otherwise, users in that level **will not be prompted to sign any agreement**.

## ⚠️ Why This Matters

If a membership level has no associated agreement, new members signing up under that level will **not see any waivers or documents to sign**. This may result in **liability issues** or unverified enrollments.

## ➕ Creating a New Agreement

To create a new agreement:

1. Click the **"Create Agreement"** button at the top of the Agreement Templates table.
2. In the form that appears:
   - **Name**: Provide a clear, descriptive name (e.g., `Adult Waiver`, `Parental Consent Form`).
   - **Body**: Use the rich text editor to enter the full text of the agreement. You can format text, add links, and upload attachments.
   - **Membership Levels**: Select one or more membership levels that this agreement applies to.

> ✅ Members in the selected levels will be required to sign this agreement during registration or check-in.

## ✏️ Editing an Existing Agreement

To update an existing agreement:

- Click the **edit icon** next to any listed agreement.
- Modify the **name**, **body content**, or **associated membership levels** as needed.
- Changes apply immediately for any members who haven’t yet signed.

---

## 🔐 Important

Make sure every active **membership level** has an associated agreement. This ensures your business is protected and that members have agreed to all necessary terms.
