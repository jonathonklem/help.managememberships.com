# Portal Settings

## Getting Started

Get started by **configuring your portal settings**.  Start by navigating to settings -> portal settings.

**IMPORTANT: Your website will not load until you've completed this step**

## Main Portal Configurations

### Name

This is the name that will be displayed prominently on your portal (which will be located at https://your-choice.managememberships.com)

### Timezone

This is used for controlling the door open times if you're using the access control module, check in times, and events and classes

### Minimum age

This will set a minimum age across-the-board for users registering to on your site.  You will also have to make sure that 'require birthdate' is checked or else there will be no birthday form on the website.

### Require picture

Check this to make it so that members will have to upload a picture to register.  This is often useful for gyms that have 24 hour access because when it's integrated with the camera system you can identify possible tail gaters or sharing of access

### Hide cancel

This option will make it so that members will have to contact you to cancel their accounts/plans

### Split fees

If you check this option, a surcharge will be added to member's fees to help cover the cost of processing

### Stripe tax ID

If you are in a jurisdiction that requires sales tax on gym memberships, we will help you set this to the correct value

### Failed billings before inactive

This is the number of times for billing to fail before the member is marked as inactive

## Email information

### Additional payment notification emails

If you have a staff member that handles payments and member outreach, set this email to have them also be alerted if a payment fails

This will be the name that all the system generated emails will show up as being 'from'
