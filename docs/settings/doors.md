# Doors

If your business uses one or more of our **Access Control Systems**, this section allows you to manage and monitor your connected doors.

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Configuration

When we install the access control hardware on your doors, we also help configure them inside your dashboard. Each door can be given a:

- **Name** (e.g. “Main Entrance” or “Back Gym Door”)
- **Description** (optional notes)
- **Access Schedule** – specific open/close times or set to "All Hours"
- **Linked Membership Levels** – restrict which members are allowed to access which doors

> 📝 After installation, you can rename, edit, or remove doors as needed.

---

## ⏰ Door Schedules

You can choose to allow access:
- **During All Hours** (e.g. 24/7 access)
- Or within a **set daily time range** (e.g. 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM)

If you choose a custom schedule, make sure to set both:
- `Open Time`
- `Close Time`

---

## 🧾 Member Access Logs

Once your access system is active:
- You can **view real-time logs** of who scans in and at what time.
- This data is useful for attendance tracking, security, or resolving disputes.

---

## 🔐 Membership-Level Restrictions

Each door can be assigned to specific **Membership Levels**. Only users in those levels will be granted access to the door.

> For example, a “Private Training Room” might only be accessible to “Premium” or “Trainer” level members.

---

## ⚠️ Deletion Protection

Doors that are associated with active memberships **cannot be deleted** until those associations are removed. This helps prevent accidental disruptions to your member access.
