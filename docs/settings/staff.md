# Staff

You can invite additional users to help manage your business through the **Staff** section of your dashboard. Each staff member has a defined **role** that determines what they can access and do in the system.

---

## 👩‍💼 Available Roles

| Role        | Permissions |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Manager**     | Full access to the system (like an owner, except they cannot delete the owner). |
| **Staff**       | Can manage member profiles and view member-related data. They **cannot** make changes to the Calendar section (e.g. creating or editing classes or shifts). |
| **Accountant**  | Only has access to financial reporting areas like income, transactions, and payment records. Cannot edit members or view the calendar. |

> 💡 You can assign or change roles by editing a staff member's profile from the Staff list.

## 🧑‍🏫 Trainer Availability

If you'd like to allow a staff member to be booked or assigned to a class as a **trainer**, just check the box labeled:

> ✅ **Trainer / Available for Classes**

in their profile.

Once enabled:

- A new **"Availability"** section appears when editing that staff member.
- You can define their available time blocks (e.g. M/W/F 9am–12pm).
- When assigning them to a class, the class **will only display** if the trainer is available during that time.

> ⛔ Trainers who are marked as unavailable will not appear for scheduling in conflicting time slots.

## 👤 Adding New Staff

You can add staff from your dashboard under the **Staff** section.

- **Free plans** cannot add staff.
- **Basic plans** allow up to 2 additional staff members.
- **All other plans** have no staff limits.
