# Triggers

The **Triggers** section allows you to set up automated actions that respond to member behavior or run on a schedule. Triggers can send text messages or emails based on conditions you define.

---

## Creating a Trigger

Click **New Trigger** to create an automation. The following fields are available:

### Name
A descriptive name for the trigger (e.g., "Re-engage At-Risk Members").

### Active
Toggle the trigger on or off. Set to **Active** to enable or **Inactive** to pause.

### Trigger Type
Choose when the trigger fires:
- **Scheduled** - Runs on a recurring schedule
- **On Invalid Door Scan** - Fires when a member scans a door but is denied access

### Schedule
When using a **Scheduled** trigger type, choose how often it runs:
- **Daily**
- **Hourly**

### Cooldown (days)
The minimum number of days that must pass before the same member can trigger this automation again. Prevents members from receiving duplicate messages.

### Dedupe Scope
Controls the deduplication window:
- **Day** - One trigger per member per day
- **Week** - One trigger per member per week
- **Forever** - Each member can only be triggered once
