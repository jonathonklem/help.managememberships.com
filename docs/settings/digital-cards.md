# Digital Cards


Your business can offer members a **digital membership card** that they can store in their **Apple Wallet** or **Google Pay**. These cards are fully branded with your logo, colors, and optional footer design.

---

## 📲 What Does the Digital Card Do?

Once configured, each member receives a **personalized membership card** that:

- Can be added to their **Apple Wallet (iPhone)** or **Google Pay (Android)**
- Displays their **name**, your business **branding**, and other key details
- Includes a **QR code** that can be scanned for:

  - ✅ **Access control** at doors equipped with QR scanners
  - ✅ **Class check-ins** at the kiosk tablet

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Set Up Your Branding**  
   In the Card Management area, you can:
   - Choose a background color
   - Upload a square logo (1:1 ratio recommended)
   - Upload an optional footer graphic

2. **Generate Test Cards**  
   Use the “Test URL” feature to preview how the card appears in Google Pay and Apple Wallet.

3. **Members Automatically Receive Their Card**  
   After setup, each member can access their digital card from their portal or receive a link via email/text.

## 🔐 Integration With Access Control

If you're using our **door access system with QR code scanners**, the digital card lets members unlock doors by simply scanning their wallet pass.

---

## 📆 Class Check-Ins

You can also place a QR scanner at your **self-check-in kiosk**, allowing members to scan their card and register attendance for scheduled classes.
