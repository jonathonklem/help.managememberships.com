# Packages

The **Packages** section allows you to define and manage time-based access blocks that bundle multiple resources or sessions together. These can be configured to operate only on certain days or times and are ideal for things like facility rental blocks, wellness bundles, or special access deals.

## 🧳 Resource Integration

Packages are generally used in coordination with resources. While this setup may vary based on your implementation, common use cases include:

- Allowing access to a group of resources under one price.
- Offering time-limited use of otherwise independent sessions.

You can build logic in your booking system to check if a user’s selected time falls within a package’s time block.

## 📝 Editing & Deleting Packages

Click the **edit icon** on any row to modify the package. All fields can be adjusted in real time.

To delete a package:
- Click the trash can icon.
- There are currently no dependency restrictions, but best practice is to ensure no active bookings rely on the package before deletion.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Keep package names clear and consistent.
- Avoid overlapping packages with the same days and time to prevent booking conflicts.
