# Kiosk

The kiosk is a self-check-in screen used by members to register for classes and mark attendance quickly. It can be used by individual members or bundle (family) accounts.

---

## How to Check In

### 1. **Enter your Info**
Type in **your email**, **name**, or **phone number** into the kiosk input field. The system will try to match it to your account.

- If **no match** is found, you’ll see an error.
- If **multiple matches** are found, you’ll be asked to pick one.

### 2. **Confirm Subscription**
The system checks if you have an **active membership** or valid **trial status**. If not, you won’t be able to proceed.

## Bundle Accounts

If your account includes **family members or dependents**, you’ll see a list of linked users after logging in.

### What you can do:
- Select a member from your bundle to check them in.
- View membership level names for each linked user.
- See which classes are available to each user.

## Agreements

If any **waivers or agreements** are pending, you’ll be prompted to sign them before you can check in. You’ll need to complete those before continuing.

---

## Available Classes

After validating your account:
- You’ll see a list of available classes **today**.
- The list is based on your gym’s time zone and your membership level.
- Only classes **within 10 minutes before or after the start time** will appear.

### Time Window
Check-in opens **10 minutes before** and closes **10 minutes after** the listed class time.
