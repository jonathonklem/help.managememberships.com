# Blog

The Blog Management tool allows you to publish content to your member portal via a simple interface. You can create posts, include images and rich content, restrict visibility to members only, and control whether the blog is enabled or disabled entirely.

This tool is available in the **owner dashboard** for businesses using the member portal system.

---

## 📢 Enabling or Disabling the Blog

You can enable or disable blog functionality for your portal by clicking either:

- **Enable Blog Posting** – Turns on the blog feature for your subdomain  
- **Disable Blog Posting** – Turns it off and hides the `/blog` page entirely

These actions appear as buttons in the blog admin interface and require confirmation.

### 📩 Waitlist Interest Tags

You can embed a waitlist interest tag directly into a blog post by inserting:

``{{ your_topic }}``

For example, typing `{{yoga}}` will embed an interest form that flags responses as interested in "yoga". These responses appear in the **Waitlist** section of your admin dashboard.
