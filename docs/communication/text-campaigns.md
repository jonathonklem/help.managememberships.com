# Text Campaigns

You can send text message campaigns directly to your members or to people on your waitlist using this tool. This guide explains how to create and manage your messages.

---

## What You Can Do

- **Send messages** to members or waitlisted contacts
- **Schedule messages** to go out at a future date and time
- **Pick who gets it** based on membership level or waitlist interest

---

## Viewing Campaigns

On the main page, you'll see a list of your past and scheduled campaigns. It includes:

- The message you sent
- When it was scheduled
- When it actually went out

You can also delete campaigns from this list if needed.

## How to Create a Campaign

Click **“Create New”** at the top. A form will appear where you can:

### 1. Write Your Message

Type your message (up to 255 characters). Keep it short and clear.

### 2. Schedule It

Pick the date and time you want the message to go out. It will automatically use your local timezone.

### 3. Choose Who Gets It

You have two options:
- **Members**: Select a specific membership level, then choose which members should receive the message. You can also click “Select All” to include everyone.  Members who have previously opted out will **NOT** be in the list.  They can opt out by replying 'stop' to any text message.
- **Waitlist**: Instead of members, you can send the message to people who signed up for updates about certain topics (like classes or openings).

If you don’t select members, the system will automatically send the message to the selected waitlist group.
