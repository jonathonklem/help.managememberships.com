# Getting started

In order for your website to work at all when someone visits the subdomain you chose, you'll need to first configure your portal settings.  You can read about that [here](/docs/settings/portal-settings).

The complete steps to start collecting payment are:

1. [Configure Portal Settings](/docs/settings/portal-settings)
2. [Create Membership Levels](/docs/membership/membership-levels)
3. [Create Agreements](/docs/membership/agreements)

If you are on a plan that supports digital ID cards, you'll also want to **[configure digital cards](/docs/settings/digital-cards)**.

After that you're ready to roll!  Feel free to peruse the rest of the documentation for information on how to use the other features!
