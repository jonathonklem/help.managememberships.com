## Notes

- Users with role `accountant` have the most limited access.
- `staff` users can see members but not manage membership levels or campaigns.
- Subscription-based gating applies mostly to `growth` and `premium` plans for advanced features like campaign tools, digital access, or scheduling resources.
- Some feature access is gated behind both role and level.

Keep this matrix updated when adding new menu items or changing access control logic.
