# Check-in Report

The Check-In Report allows you to view and analyze member attendance across your classes.

## How It Works

- **Start Date** and **End Date** selectors let you choose the date range you want to analyze.
- A summary table will appear, showing:
  - The name of the class
  - The date of the check-ins
  - The number of check-ins for that class on that day

## Viewing Member Names

You can click any row in the summary table to reveal the names of members who checked in to that specific class.

This is useful for:

- Verifying attendance
- Following up with specific members
- Spotting frequent or missing participants

## Visual Chart

Below the table, a bar chart displays the total number of check-ins per class.

This gives you a quick visual overview of which classes are most active during the selected date range.

## Tips

- The data automatically updates whenever you change the date range.
- If a class row shows "No Class", that means the check-in wasn't tied to a specific class (e.g., open mat or drop-ins).
- You can use this report to track attendance trends over time or identify underperforming sessions.
